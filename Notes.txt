7/22 Nobody gets taxed in the current code
	7/23 Some tax stuff in, may not be perfect 
		Might be refined after other stuff fixed

7/22 We are not sure about the stochastic structure piece of Table 1 in AGG
n may be number of points in Tauchen, what is m? 

7/22 Female is not currently getting child support payments
They are being taken from males
	7/23 In there, but needs to be changed a little 
		Not calculating average income yet, just set to be a number

7/23 Now draws in the second marriage market are working (we think)
	-but divorce probability doesn't change when h increaseds

7/23 Our human capital transmission function is different (better?)

7/22 Not sure why theta1=0.01 and delta1=0.05 in header- 0.1 and 0.5
as is, average income is about 0 and human capital transfer is negative
if "corrected" to 0.1 and 0.5- no convergence

7/22 Not sure what zeta=0.325 and eta=0.5 are, nowhere in jw.ox
